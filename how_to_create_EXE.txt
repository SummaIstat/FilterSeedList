open the Anaconda terminal
cd into the folder containing the python file to be transformed in exe
conda activate name_of_the_environment_used_to_compile_the_file
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller name_of_the_script.py --onefile

If you also want to add an icon in ico format:
pyinstaller name_of_the_script.py --icon=myIcon.ico --onefile

Copy the generated exe file located in the dist folder (that has been generated)

Now you can delete (they are no more usefull):
- the "build" and "dist" folders
- the ".spec" file

=======================================

Example:
cd C:\py\FilterSeedList\auto
conda activate FilterSeedList
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller FilterSeedList.py --icon=icon.ico --onefile
